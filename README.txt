This project is based on "OBJECT DETECTION using R-CNN and Support Vector Machine"

Description:
Computer Vision is a field of study that helps to develop techniques to recognize images and displays.
Deep learning is currently the mainstream method of object detection. 
Region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) have a pivotal position in deep learning.

In this project we had used the concept of 
	- Convolutional Neural Network 
	- Selective Search segmentation Algorithm
	- Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks(R-CNN)
	- Support Vector Machine(SVM)

Guide for the project:
	- The project file has "Team_4_PML.ipynb" file has the implementation of object detection.
	- "image" and "Airplanes_Annotations" are folders having the datasets 
	- "my_h5_mmodel.h5" is the 1st model saved in the .h5 format 
	- "fin_model" will have the saved format of final model
	- "Team04_19AIE205.pdf" is the Report file
	- "Team04_19AIE205.pptx" ppt file
*It took very more time for training so we had saved into saved format so that, next can use that directly without training
	- The project folder also have the Report and ppt for the project. 
 

The project has been done by Team 04 as a part of end-semester project of Sem III by CSE(AI) 2020-2024 batch students of Amrita Vishwa Vidhyapeetham.
