# Object-Detection-Using-R_CNN-and-SVM

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Deep learning has gained an amazing impact on how the world adapts to Artificial Intelligence. The field of computer vision and discovery continues to evolve. Computer Vision is a field of research that helps to develop visual imagery and display techniques. It has different features such as image recognition, object detection and image creation, etc. Object detection is used for face detection, vehicle detection, web images, and security systems. Many algorithms and modules came along, Deep learning is now a mainstream method of object detection. Regional Based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) networks have an important role to play in in-depth learning. It has amazing results to find in regular forums. However, under special circumstances, there may still be unsatisfactory performance of the detection, such as something with problems such as closure, deterioration, or small size. In this project, we used Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) AND Support Vector Machine(SVM) for object detection. By using the selective search segmentation algorithm and annotation datasets we train the neural network model with Support Vector Machines. So finally we will get the plot of loss and accuracy. Then we will test the model, by importing a random image and predicting it, it returns the plot of image with a boundary box over the object in the image. </p>

#### In this project we had used the concept of 
- Convolutional Neural Network 
- Selective Search segmentation Algorithm
- Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks(R-CNN)
- Support Vector Machine(SVM)

#### Guide for the project:
- The project file has "Team_4_PML.ipynb" file has the implementation of object detection.
- "image" and "Airplanes_Annotations" are folders having the datasets 
- "my_h5_mmodel.h5" is the 1st model saved in the .h5 format 
- "fin_model" will have the saved format of final model
- "Team04_19AIE205.pdf" is the Report file
- "Team04_19AIE205.pptx" ppt file

**Link For the Trained Model (.h5) -> [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m9rNiM4cusVFQgABdgog0h71H-GRYual?usp=sharing)  (Keep in Same Directory)**
##### It took very more time for training so we had saved into saved format(.h5) so that, next time need not to train the model again 
- The Repository Have the Report With detailed Explanation and ppt for the project.
